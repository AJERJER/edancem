            <p>Christopher Comstock (Born: May 19, 1992 [age 26]) better known by his stage name Marshmello, is an
                American EDM producer and DJ. He first gained international recognition by remixing songs by Jack Ãœ and
                Zedd. He currently has over 19.2 million subscribers and 3.2 billion views on his YouTube channel.
                <br><br>
                Marshmello debuted on Monstercat with his song "Alone", which appeared on the compilation album
                Monstercat 027 - Cataclysm. On June 3, 2016, it was announced that there would be a remix contest for
                "Alone". The winner would have their remix released by Monstercat and a chance to play an opening DJ
                set at Camp Bisco. It was later announced that future house duo MRVLZ had won the contest.
