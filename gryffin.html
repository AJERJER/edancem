            <p>Dan Griffith, known by his stage name Gryffin (often stylized as GRYFFIN), is an American DJ, record
                producer and musician.
                <br><br>
                Gryffin grew up as a classically trained pianist and learned to play the guitar at an early age. He
                played in bands to initially hone his instrumental abilities. He studied electrical engineering at the
                University of Southern California where he took much of his leisure time in his dorm room to work on
                music.
                <br><br>
                When asked on his key lessons of music production, he said "At the beginning, I just released music
                with the main goal of having my friends play it at college parties and I never would have imagined it
                would get to this point". He made his 'world' debut at the SnowGlobe Music Festival 2015. He moved to
                Los Angeles to be closer to his label and management.
